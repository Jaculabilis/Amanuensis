# The cli module must not import other parts of the application at the module
# level. This is because most other modules depend on the config module. The
# config module may depend on __main__'s commandline parsing to locate config
# files, and __main__'s commandline parsing requires importing (but not
# executing) the functions in the cli module. Thus, cli functions must only
# import the config module inside the various command methods, which are only
# run after commandline parsing has already occurred.
